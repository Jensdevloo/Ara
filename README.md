Ara
===

The Ara (Advanced Realtime Analytics) toolkit is a suite of tasks in context of Big Data.
It is then possible to:

-Continuously connect to streams (the best example is Twitter 1% sample streaming)
-Store data in relational databases (MySQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB)
-Apply some filters on data 
-Realise analysis in both realtime and batch computation

The different tasks are arranged into workflows

Ara toolkit takes its roots into realtime computation (Storm), batch computation (Hadoop) and analytics (Pig and Hive)
